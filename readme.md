Ensure you have the following software installed:

- <a href ="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads">Microsoft SQL Server</a>
- <a href ="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>

<br><br>

1) ### Create a **fork** of this repository to work with
<div style="margin-left: 10%">
    <div>
        <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83a4311a-5d2b-427c-bf88-9ca33ceabbbf" width="80%" alt="Select Fork">

    </div>
</div>
<br><br>

2) ### Implement interfaces to meet the requirements.
    - Implement `GetProductAsync()` method of `ProductService` so it returns **the most expensive** Product that is currently `Reserved`
    - Implement `GetProductsAsync()` method of `ProductService` so it returns only Products that were delivered to the warehouse in 2025 with a quantity greater than 1000
    - Implement `GetWarehouseAsync()` method of `WarehouseService` so it returns a Warehouse with the **highest total value** of products that are `ReadyForDistribution`
    - Implement the `GetWarehousesAsync()` method of `WarehouseService` so that it returns Warehouses that received products in the second quarter of 2025
    
    **IMPORTANT**:  Do **NOT** change any files except of `ProductService`.cs and `WarehouseService`.cs
